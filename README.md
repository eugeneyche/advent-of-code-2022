# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to problems in the Advent of Code 2022.

All solutions are written in Golang, because I am using AoC to practice the language.
Most of the code will probably not be perfect, but please bear with me. ðŸ˜Š

## Running Solutions

Most solutions will contain 3 files:

- `main.go` - the source code
- `sample.txt` - the sample input provided in the question
- `input.txt` - the input generated for me by AoC

In some cases, multiple sample inputs can be given for a single problem. Those
additional inputs will be in their own separate files, e.g. `sample_large.txt`.

To run the solutions, first compile the source code with `go build main.go`.

Execute the binary by passing in the path of the input as the first argument

```bash
$ ./main sample.txt # Runs sample input
$ ./main input.txt  # Runs actual input
```
